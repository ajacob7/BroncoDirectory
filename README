Installation Steps:

1. Copy the unzipped BroncoDirectory folder into the /webpages/<username>/ folder on the scu linux machine. 
(Note: replace <username> with your username without the angle brackets)

2. While in the /webpages/<username>/ folder outside of the BroncoDirectory folder, 
enter: "chmod 715 BroncoDirectory/*" without quotes into the terminal and press enter to execute files
on scu server and protect the files from being accessed by other users.

3.  Enter the BroncoDirectory folder and enter : "vi setup.ini" in the terminal without quotes to open 
	the file. In this file, you will see:
							db_user = username
							db_pass = password
	Here, you will edit the file and replace username with your oracle username and password with your
	oracle password and then save and exit. This will allow you to login to your database on the oracle.

4.  Also in the BroncoDirectory folder, enter "vi .htaccess in the terminal and add this line: 
	"AddType application/x-httpd-php .html .htm"

5. 	Next, while inside the BroncoDirectory folder, you will enter: "setup oracle" in the terminal without quotes to setup up the oracle.
	Afterwards, enter: "sqlplus username@db11g" into the terminal without quotes and replace username with
	 your linux username. You will be prompted to enter your password for oracle and after doing so will log 
	 in successfully. After logging in successfully, enter: "start tables.sql" without quotes to start the tables.
	 It should say procedure successfully completed, in which you will then enter exit into terminal to exit oracle.
	 (Warning: It is vital to exit oracle to ensure proper functionality of the database)

6.	Now the web application should be up and running. To access the website, simply copy and paste the following address in your desired
	internet browser and replace username with your username.
